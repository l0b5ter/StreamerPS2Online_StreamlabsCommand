Made by: lobster/loster31345 from WiAD                           

## Functions:
1. On command in chat will make the bot lookup which character the streamer is playing as!
2. Works with discord
3. Supports unlimited characters
4. Simple and clean way to add and removed.


## Instructions on how to get it up
1. download .zip
2. Open the .zip folder.
3. Three are files for each faction, look into the "Example" folder for example.
Or just move them into your "Config" folder and replace the character names in each of them.
4. Default command is "ign" (however if you wanna change this, open the "StreamerPS2Online_StreamlabsSystem.py" in a text editor like notepad++ and change the variable Command. ```Command = "ign"```)
5. This folder is in a zip-file, so click on import in the streamlabs chat bot "Scripts" tab and select the .zip folder
6. Yay you done mate, just reload the scripts and see the magic^^

## Notice:
Only put your characters in the files. If there is more than 1 online at the same time, will make the script pick the first character in the list.

Feel free to take a look at the script "StreamerPS2Online_StreamlabsCommand.py", however if you make a change dont come and say its not working. Ill galdly help fix or improve it^^
